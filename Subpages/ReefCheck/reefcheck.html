    <p class="hero-description">Our mission is simple—but not really.
      Every year, we train thousands of citizen scientist volunteers to survey the health of tropical coral reefs around the world and kelp forest ecosystems along the entire coast of California.Founded in 1996, the Reef Check Foundation is an international non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation of tropical coral reefs and temperate kelp forests. With offices in Los Angeles and Santa Cruz, California and volunteer teams in more than 40 countries and territories, Reef Check’s mission is to lead citizen scientists who promote stewardship of sustainable reef communities around the globe.

      Reef Check performs three vital tasks necessary to promote stewardship of sustainable reef communities worldwide:
      
      We train and organize teams of local volunteer citizen scientist divers. They collect data on reef health and assess climate change impacts on their reefs. Their work produces reliable information used by marine resource managers, scientists, and policymakers to make science-based ocean management and conservation decisions.
      We promote public education about reefs and the ocean. Our goal is to develop a team of ocean ambassadors with the skills and knowledge to make a tangible difference in marine conservation in their local communities. Our immersive youth education programs train participants to understand the threats marine ecosystems face and give them the tools to become ocean stewards.
      We develop ecologically sound and economically sustainable solutions for reef conservation and restoration.</p>
