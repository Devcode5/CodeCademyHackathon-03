    <p class="hero-description-gue" >We are a leader in scuba education, having developed numerous industry-first training protocols and utilizing an elite cast of diving educators.

      GUE provides training for non-divers, recreational divers, cave and technical divers, and instructors from other agencies, all in an effort to elevate the quality of training within the dive industry.We seek to establish a new relationship with the aquatic world, forged by refined diving skills and supported by passionate divers.

      Exploring, observing, and documenting the underwater environment is critical to protecting it from threats, deliberate or inadvertent, and thereby helping conserve our aquatic heritage for future generations.
      
      GUEâ€™s commitment to conservation is also reflected in our efforts to improve our operations in ways that reduce waste and promote sustainability in our new Conservation Pledge.</p>
